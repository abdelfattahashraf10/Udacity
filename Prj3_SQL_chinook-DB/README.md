# SQL Data Analysis Project

This project is part of my learning journey in the **Udacity Scholarship for Business Analytics & Digital Freelancing**, sponsored by the **International Labor Organization**. The objective is to analyze a digital music store's database to extract meaningful business insights using SQL.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on several key areas:

1. **Artist Earnings**: Identifying the top-earning artists and comparing their sales performance.
2. **Album Revenue**: Determining the most popular albums based on total revenue, with "Battlestar Galactica (Classic)" leading the charts.
3. **Customer Analysis**: Finding the best customers by total spending and examining their purchasing patterns across different genres.
4. **Media Type Preferences**: Analyzing customer preferences for media types, revealing that MPEG audio files account for 84% of total sales.

## Dataset

The dataset represents a digital music store's sales data, including information on artists, albums, tracks, customers, invoices, and invoice lines.

## SQL Queries

The analysis was conducted using SQL queries to extract and process data. Key queries include:

- **Top Artist Earnings**: Calculates total earnings per artist to identify the highest earners.
- **Album Revenue**: Sums revenue per album to find the most popular ones.
- **Customer Spending**: Aggregates total spending per customer to determine top buyers.
- **Genre Sales**: Analyzes total sales by genre to understand customer preferences.
- **Media Type Sales**: Evaluates sales distribution across different media types.

## Insights

- **Top Artist**: The artist with the highest sales achieved 105 units, indicating strong performance.
- **Album Popularity**: "Battlestar Galactica (Classic)" leads with 36 units of revenue, contributing significantly to overall sales.
- **Genre Preferences**: Rock is the top-selling genre, showing a strong customer preference.
- **Media Types**: MPEG audio files dominate sales, accounting for 84.01% of total sales.

## Getting Started
