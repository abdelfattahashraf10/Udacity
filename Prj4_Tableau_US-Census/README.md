# US Census Demographic Data Analysis

This project is part of my learning journey in the **Udacity Scholarship for Business Analytics & Digital Freelancing**, sponsored by the **International Labor Organization**. The objective is to analyze US Census Demographic Data and present insights through interactive visualizations created in **Tableau**.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on two primary dashboards:
1. **Poverty and Income Insights**:
   - Examines the correlation between income levels and poverty across different states.
2. **Transportation and Industry Insights**:
   - Highlights state-level efficiency in transportation and examines the relationship between the construction sector and poverty.

## Insights

### Dashboard 1: Poverty and Income Insights
- **Highest Poverty States**:
  - States like **Texas** and **Puerto Rico** lead with significant poverty counts, followed by **Georgia** and **Kentucky**.
- **Most Income States**:
  - Texas, Virginia, and Georgia emerged as the states with the highest income levels.
- **Income and Poverty Across America**:
  - A scatter plot reveals an inverse relationship: states with higher average income generally show lower poverty levels.
- **Main Story**:
  - While Texas leads in income, it also has high poverty counts, indicating disparities within its population.

### Dashboard 2: Transportation and Industry Insights
- **Best Transportation Across States**:
  - States like **North Dakota** and **Vermont** show efficient transportation with shorter commute times, while **Puerto Rico** and **New York** report longer average commutes.
- **Construction and Poverty**:
  - A word cloud highlights states with high poverty, suggesting that construction-related employment could influence economic well-being.
- **Main Story**:
  - Longer commute times are linked to infrastructure challenges, while construction employment shows varying impacts on poverty across states.

## Visualizations

Here are the key Tableau visualizations used in the project:
1. **Poverty and Income Dashboard**:
   - Includes bar charts and scatter plots to compare state-level income and poverty.
2. **Transportation and Construction Dashboard**:
   - Features bar charts and a word cloud to examine transportation efficiency and construction-sector insights.
3. **Population Map**:
   - A geographic visualization showing population distribution across states.

## Design Choices

- **Bar Charts**:
  - Used for comparing categorical data (states) with numerical values (poverty, income, commute times).
  - **Color Palette**: A consistent blue palette for clarity and minimal distractions.
- **Scatter Plot**:
  - Highlights correlations between income and poverty, revealing trends and outliers.
  - **Color Palette**: Distinct colors for each state to differentiate data points.
- **Word Cloud**:
  - Visualizes construction-related insights, emphasizing states with higher relevance.
